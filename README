SYNOPSIS
      # in a lite app with default suffix -min

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin looks at the file name and content type to compress
    stylesheets.

CONFIGURATION
    suffix  String or regular expression object used as suffix to match
            against the request filename. The suffix will be stripped out
            and used to get the source file to compress. Using and empty
            string as suffix means all css content will be compressed even
            without suffix.
